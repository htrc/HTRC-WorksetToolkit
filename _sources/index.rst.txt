Welcome to the HTRC Python SDK's documentation!
=================================================
The HTRC Python SDK provides a command line interface for interacting with 
and analyzing volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library:

- Volume Download (``htrc download``)
- Metadata Download (``htrc metadata``)
- Pre-built Analysis Workflows (``htrc run``)
- Export of volume lists (``htrc export``)

Each of these commands takes a :ref:`workset path`, which is one of 7 types of
identifiers. Almost any web page on http://hathitrust.org is a valid identifier,
including the PageTurner view, Catalog record view, and Collection Builder
collections.

More details on each command can be found on the :ref:`HTRC Python CLI` page.

In addition, it provides a software development kit (SDK) for working with the
HathiTrust Digital Library materials. It was designed for use in the HTRC Data
Capsule service, which is the target distribution. It has the following aspects:

- An access layer for the Bibliographic API (``htrc.metadata``)
- An access layer for the Data API (``htrc.volumes``)
- Pre-built analysis workflows (``htrc.tools``)
- Provenance tracking for verification of non-consumptive exports (``htrc.prov``)
- Mock testing interface for user-machine or maintenance-mode testing (``htrc.mock``)
- Utilities for record and volume resolution (``htrc.util``)

More details on each module can be found on the :ref:`HTRC Python SDK` page.
